Academic Project: Computational Solution for Agriculture
Description
This academic project was developed as part of a course in the Computer Science undergraduate program. The goal was to create a practical solution to problems in the agricultural domain, using an object-oriented approach and based on a well-defined domain model.

The application runs in the console and combines various technical components, ranging from recursive algorithms to database interactions, providing a clear example of integration between multiple technologies and programming paradigms.
